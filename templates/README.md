Website Templates
=================

This folder contains all the templates available to the _PoliteJS_ compiler.

### Set Active Template

You can easily set the default template prefixing it with an "*":

```
template1/
*template3/ (this is the active one)
template3/
```

> - If more than one template is set as active then the first one is used.
> - If no active template is found then the first listed template will be used.
